# Carpool-Commuting-System
A web site to improve the urban environment by enabling neighbors to commuter carpool and reduce the amount of cars on the roads, thereby reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. Visitors to the site will be able to register with the site as members and provide information about their daily commute; starting point, destination, times and whether they are looking to obtain or provide a lift, or both. Casual visitors to the site will be able to search through the posts to see if anyone faces a similar commute to theirs. Full details of other commuters and their journeys will only be available after registering.
